# üìä Zomato Data Analysis
This project is about SQL to perform exploratory data analysis. The data set is a dummy data set much like Zomato and with some minimal data. This project is basically done to gain some better knowledge and have a more tighter grip upon SQL. For this I have used Microsoft SQL server.

## üóÇ Creating Database
Created a database of a food website like Zomato with and inserted some dummy data to do some analysis upon the data. The database, named zomato_data contains 4 tables: goldusers_signup, users, sales, and product.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ creating table goldusers_signup:
        drop table if exists goldusers_signup;
        CREATE TABLE goldusers_signup(userid integer,gold_signup_date date);
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ creating table product:
        drop table if exists product;
        CREATE TABLE product(product_id integer,product_name text,price integer);
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ creating table users:
        drop table if exists users;
        CREATE TABLE users(userid integer,signup_date date);
## 4Ô∏è‚É£ creating table sales:
        drop table if exists sales;
        CREATE TABLE sales(userid integer,created_date date,product_id integer);
## üìà Some Analysis That Are Performed
From next are some important questions based on which analysis is performed. Some these questions are really important in improving upon any particular product, the business model.
